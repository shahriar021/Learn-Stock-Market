            <p>
              In a downtrend, prices fall because there is an excess of supply
              over demand. The lower prices go, the more attractive prices
              become to those waiting on the sidelines to buy the shares. At
              some level, demand that would have been slowly increasing will
              rise to the level where it matches supply. At this point, prices
              will stop falling. This is support. Support can be a price level
              on the chart or a price zone. In any event, support is an area on
              a price chart that shows buyers’ willingness to buy. It is at this
              level that demand will usually overwhelm supply, causing the price
              decline to halt and reverse.
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-item-2">What Is Resistance?</h4>
            <p>
              Resistance is the opposite of support. Prices move up because
              there is more demand than supply. As prices move higher, there
              will come a point when selling will overwhelm the desire to buy.
              This happens for a variety of reasons. It could be that traders
              have determined that prices are too high or have met their target.
              It could be the reluctance of buyers to initiate new positions at
              such rich valuations. It could be for any other number of reasons.
              But a technician will clearly see on a price chart a level at
              which supply begins to overwhelm demand. This is resistance. Like
              support, it can be a level or a zone. Once an area or “zone” of
              support or resistance has been identified, those price levels can
              serve as potential entry or exit points because, as price reaches
              a point of previous support or resistance, it will do one of two
              things: bounce back away from the support or resistance level, or
              violate the price level and continue in its prior direction—until
              it hits the next support or resistance level. The timing of some
              trades is based on the belief that support and resistance zones
              will not be broken. Whether the price is halted by or breaks
              through the support or resistance level, traders can “bet” on the
              direction of price and can quickly determine if they are correct.
              If the price moves in the wrong direction (breaks through prior
              support or resistance levels), the position can be closed at a
              small loss. If the price moves in the right direction (respects
              prior support or resistance levels), however, the move may be
              substantial.

              Support and resistance can be found in all charting time periods;
              daily, weekly, monthly. Traders also find support and resistance
              in smaller time frames like one-minute and five-minute charts. But
              the longer the time period, the more significant the support or
              resistance. To identify support or resistance, you have to look
              back at the chart to find a significant pause in a price decline
              or rise. Then look forward to see whether a price halts and/or
              reverses as it approaches that level. As has been noted above,
              many experienced traders will pay attention to past support or
              resistance levels and place traders in anticipation of a future
              similar reaction at these levels. Technical analysis is not an
              exact science, and sometimes price will dip below support levels
              or reverse before it gets to the prior support level. The same is
              true for resistance: Price may reverse before it gets to the prior
              resistance level or break above it. In each case, flexibility is
              required in interpreting these chart patterns. This is why support
              and resistance levels are sometimes referred to as zones. There is
              nothing magical about these price levels. It is simply that many
              market participants are acting off the same information and
              placing trades at similar levels. Most experienced traders can
              share stories about how the price of an asset tends to halt when
              it gets to a certain level. For example, assume that Jim was
              holding a position in stock from March to November and that he was
              expecting the value of the shares to increase. Let’s imagine that
              Jim notices that the price fails to get above $39 several times
              over several months, even though it has gotten very close to
              moving above that level. In this case, traders would call the
              price level near $39 a level of resistance. As you can see from
              the chart below, resistance levels are also regarded as a ceiling
              because these price levels represent areas where a rally runs out
              of gas.Support levels are on the flip side of the coin. Support
              refers to the price level on a chart where equilibrium is reached.
              This means that demand has increased to match supply. This causes
              the decline in the price of the asset to halt; therefore, price
              has reached a price floor. As you can see from the chart below,
              the horizontal line below price represents the price floor. You
              can see by the blue arrows underneath the vertical line that price
              has touched this level four times in the past. This is the level
              where demand comes in, preventing further declines. This is
              support.

            <p>
              A previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level
              when the price attempts to move back up, and conversely, a
              resistance level will become a support level as the price
              temporarily falls back. Price charts allow traders and investors
              to visually identify areas of support and resistance, and they
              give clues regarding the significance of these price levels. More
              specifically, they look at: Number of Touches The more times that
              the price tests a support or resistance area, the more significant
              the level becomes. When prices keep bouncing off a support or
              resistance level, more buyers and sellers notice and will base
              trading decisions on these levels. Preceding Price Move Support
              and resistance zones are likely to be more significant when they
              are preceded by steep advances or declines. For example, a fast,
              steep advance or uptrend will be met with more competition and
              enthusiasm and may be halted by a more significant resistance
              level than a slow, steady advance. A slow advance may not attract
              as much attention. This is a good example of how market psychology
              drives technical indicators. Volume at Certain Price Levels The
              more buying and selling that has occurred at a particular price
              level, the stronger the support or resistance level is likely to
              be. This is because traders and investors remember these price
              levels and are apt to use them again. When strong activity occurs
              on high volume and the price drops, a lot of selling will likely
              occur when price returns to that level, since people are far more
              comfortable closing out a trade at the breakeven point than at a
              loss. Time Support and resistance zones seen in longer time frame
              charts such as weekly or monthly charts are often more significant
              than those seen in shorter time frame charts such as the
              one-minute or five-minute chart.
