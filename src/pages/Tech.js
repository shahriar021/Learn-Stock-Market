            <h4 id="list-item-1">What is Technical Analysis?</h4>
            <p>
              Technical analysis is a tool, or method, used to predict the
              probable future price movement of a security – such as a stock or
              currency pair – based on market data. The theory behind the
              validity of technical analysis is the notion that the collective
              actions – buying and selling – of all the participants in the
              market accurately reflect all relevant information pertaining to a
              traded security, and therefore, continually assign a fair market
              value to the security.
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-item-2">Charting on Different Time Frames</h4>
            <p>
              Technical traders analyze price charts to attempt to predict price
              movement. The two primary variables for technical analysis are the
              time frames considered and the particular technical indicators
              that a trader chooses to utilize. The technical analysis time
              frames shown on charts range from one-minute to monthly, or even
              yearly, time spans. Popular time frames that technical analysts
              most frequently examine include: 5-minute chart 15-minute chart
              Hourly chart 4-hour chart Daily chart The time frame a trader
              selects to study is typically determined by that individual
              trader’s personal trading style. Intra-day traders, traders who
              open and close trading positions within a single trading day,
              favor analyzing price movement on shorter time frame charts, such
              as the 5-minute or 15-minute charts. Long-term traders who hold
              market positions overnight and for long periods of time are more
              inclined to analyze markets using hourly, 4-hour, daily, or even
              weekly charts. Price movement that occurs within a 15-minute time
              span may be very significant for an intra-day trader who is
              looking for an opportunity to realize a profit from price
              fluctuations occurring during one trading day. However, that same
              price movement viewed on a daily or weekly chart may not be
              particularly significant or indicative for long-term trading
              purposes. It’s simple to illustrate this by viewing the same price
              action on different time frame charts. The following daily chart
              for silver shows price trading within the same range, from roughly
              $16 to $18.50, that it’s been in for the past several months. A
              long-term silver investor might be inclined to look to buy silver
              based on the fact that the price is fairly near the low of that
              range.

            <h4 id="list-item-3">Candlesticks</h4>
            <p>
              Candlestick charting is the most commonly used method of showing
              price movement on a chart. A candlestick is formed from the price
              action during a single time period for any time frame. Each
              candlestick on an hourly chart shows the price action for one
              hour, while each candlestick on a 4-hour chart shows the price
              action during each 4-hour time period. Candlesticks are “drawn” /
              formed as follows: The highest point of a candlestick shows the
              highest price a security traded at during that time period, and
              the lowest point of the candlestick indicates the lowest price
              during that time. The “body” of a candlestick (the respective red
              or blue “blocks”, or thicker parts, of each candlestick as shown
              in the charts above) indicates the opening and closing prices for
              the time period. If a blue candlestick body is formed, this
              indicates that the closing price (top of the candlestick body) was
              higher than the opening price (bottom of the candlestick body);
              conversely, if a red candlestick body is formed, then the opening
              price was higher than the closing price. Candlestick colors are
              arbitrary choices. Some traders use white and black candlestick
              bodies (this is the default color format, and therefore the one
              most commonly used); other traders may choose to use green and
              red, or blue and yellow. Whatever colors are chosen, they provide
              an easy way to determine at a glance whether price closed higher
              or lower at the end of a given time period. Technical analysis
              using a candlestick charts is often easier than using a standard
              bar chart, as the analyst receives more visual cues and patterns.
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-item-4">Candlestick Patterns – Dojis</h4>
            <p>
              Candlestick patterns, which are formed by either a single
              candlestick or by a succession of two or three candlesticks, are
              some of the most widely used technical indicators for identifying
              potential market reversals or trend change. Doji candlesticks, for
              example, indicate indecision in a market that may be a signal for
              an impending trend change or market reversal. The singular
              characteristic of a doji candlestick is that the opening and
              closing prices are the same, so that the candlestick body is a
              flat line. The longer the upper and/or lower “shadows”, or
              “tails”, on a doji candlestick – the part of the candlestick that
              indicates the low-to-high range for the time period – the stronger
              the indication of market indecision and potential reversal. There
              are several variations of doji candlesticks, each with its own
              distinctive name, as shown in the illustration below. Technical
              Analysis - Doji Candlesticks The typical doji is the long-legged
              doji, where price extends about equally in each direction, opening
              and closing in the middle of the price range for the time period.
              The appearance of the candlestick gives a clear visual indication
              of indecision in the market. When a doji like this appears after
              an extended uptrend or downtrend in a market, it is commonly
              interpreted as signaling a possible market reversal, a trend
              change to the opposite direction. The dragonfly doji, when
              appearing after a prolonged downtrend, signals a possible upcoming
              reversal to the upside. Examination of the price action indicated
              by the dragonfly doji explains its logical interpretation. The
              dragonfly shows sellers pushing price substantially lower (the
              long lower tail), but at the end of the period, price recovers to
              close at its highest point. The candlestick essentially indicates
              a rejection of the extended push to the downside. The gravestone
              doji’s name clearly hints that it represents bad news for buyers.
              The opposite of the dragonfly formation, the gravestone doji
              indicates a strong rejection of an attempt to push market prices
              higher, and thereby suggests a potential downside reversal may
              follow. The rare, four price doji, where the market opens, closes,
              and in-between conducts all buying and selling at the exact same
              price throughout the time period, is the epitome of indecision, a
              market that shows no inclination to go anywhere in particular.
              There are dozens of different candlestick formations, along with
              several pattern variations. Probably the most complete resource
              for identifying and utilizing candlestick patterns is Thomas
              Bulkowski’s pattern site, which thoroughly explains each
              candlestick pattern and even provides statistics on how often each
              pattern has historically given a reliable trading signal. It’s
              certainly helpful to know what a candlestick pattern indicates –
              but it’s even more helpful to know if that indication has proven
              to be accurate 80% of the time.

            <h4 id="list-item-5">Technical Indicators – Moving Averages</h4>
            <p>
              In addition to studying candlestick formations, technical traders
              can draw from a virtually endless supply of technical indicators
              to assist them in making trading decisions. Moving averages are
              probably the single most widely-used technical indicator. Many
              trading strategies utilize one or more moving averages. A simple
              moving average trading strategy might be something like, “Buy as
              long as price remains above the 50-period exponential moving
              average (EMA); Sell as long as price remains below the 50 EMA”.
              Moving average crossovers are another frequently employed
              technical indicator. A crossover trading strategy might be to buy
              when the 10-period moving average crosses above the 50-period
              moving average. The higher a moving average number is, the more
              significant price movement in relation to it is considered. For
              example, price crossing above or below a 100- or 200-period moving
              average is usually considered much more significant than price
              moving above or below a 5-period moving average.

              Technical Indicators – Pivots and Fibonacci Numbers
            </h4>
            <p>
              Daily pivot point indicators, which usually also identify several
              support and resistance levels in addition to the pivot point, are
              used by many traders to identify price levels for entering or
              closing out trades. Pivot point levels often mark significant
              support or resistance levels or the levels where trading is
              contained within a range. If trading soars (or plummets) through
              the daily pivot and all the associated support or resistance
              levels, this is interpreted by many traders as “breakout” trading
              that will shift market prices substantially higher or lower, in
              the direction of the breakout. Daily pivot points and their
              corresponding support and resistance levels are calculated using
              the previous trading day’s high, low, opening and closing prices.
              I’d show you the calculation, but there’s really no need, as pivot
              point levels are widely published each trading day and there are
              pivot point indicators you can just load on a chart that do the
              calculations for you and reveal pivot levels. Most pivot point
              indicators show the daily pivot point along with three support
              levels below the pivot point and three price resistance levels
              above it.

            <h4 id="list-item-7">Fibonacci Retracements </h4>
            <p>
              Fibonacci levels are another popular technical analysis tool.
              Fibonacci was a 12th-century mathematician who developed a series
              of ratios that is very popular with technical traders. Fibonacci
              ratios, or levels, are commonly used to pinpoint trading
              opportunities and both trade entry and profit targets that arise
              during sustained trends. The primary Fibonacci ratios are 0.24,
              0.38, 0.62, and 0.76. These are often expressed as percentages –
              23%, 38%, etc. Note that Fibonacci ratios complement other
              Fibonacci ratios: 24% is the opposite, or remainder, of 76%, and
              38% is the opposite, or remainder, of 62%. As with pivot point
              levels, there are numerous freely available technical indicators
              that will automatically calculate and load Fibonacci levels onto a
              chart. Fibonacci retracements are the most often used Fibonacci
              indicator. After a security has been in a sustained uptrend or
              downtrend for some time, there is frequently a corrective
              retracement in the opposite direction before price resumes the
              overall long-term trend. Fibonacci retracements are used to
              identify good, low-risk trade entry points during such a
              retracement. For example, assume that the price of stock “A” has
              climbed steadily from $10 to $40. Then the stock price begins to
              fall back a bit. Many investors will look for a good entry level
              to buy shares during such a price retracement. Fibonacci numbers
              suggest that likely price retracements will extend a distance
              equal to 24%, 38%, 62%, or 76% of the uptrend move from $10 to
              $40. Investors watch these levels for indications that the market
              is finding support from where price will begin rising again. For
              example, if you were hoping for a chance to buy the stock after
              approximately a 38% retracement in price, you might enter an order
              to buy around the $31 price level. (The move from $10 to $40 =
              $30; 38% of $30 is $9; $40 – $9 = $31)
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-item-8">Technical Indicators – Momentum Indicators</h4>
            <p>
              Moving averages and most other technical indicators are primarily
              focused on determining likely market direction, up or down. There
              is another class of technical indicators, however, whose main
              purpose is not so much to determine market direction as to
              determine market strength. These indicators include such popular
              tools as the Stochastic Oscillator, the Relative Strength Index
              (RSI), the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) indicator,
              and the Average Directional Movement Index (ADX). By measuring the
              strength of price movement, momentum indicators help investors
              determine whether current price movement more likely represents
              relatively insignificant, range-bound trading or an actual,
              significant trend. Because momentum indicators measure trend
              strength, they can serve as early warning signals that a trend is
              coming to an end. For example, if a security has been trading in a
              strong, sustained uptrend for several months, but then one or more
              momentum indicators signals the trend steadily losing strength, it
              may be time to think about taking profits. The 4-hour chart of
              USD/SGD below illustrates the value of a momentum indicator. The
              MACD indicator appears in a separate window below the main chart
              window. The sharp upturn in the MACD beginning around June 14th
              indicates that the corresponding upsurge in price is a strong,
              trending move rather than just a temporary correction. When price
              begins to retrace downward somewhat on the 16th, the MACD shows
              weaker price action, indicating that the downward movement in
              price does not have much strength behind it. Soon after that, a
              strong uptrend resumes. In this instance, the MACD would have
              helped provide reassurance to a buyer of the market that (A) the
              turn to the upside was a significant price move and (B) that the
              uptrend was likely to resume after the price dipped slightly on
              the 16th.
