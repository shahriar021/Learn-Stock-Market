            <p>
              For every rupee of profit made by a trader, there must be a trader
              losing that rupee. As an extension of this, if a group of traders
              consistently make money, then there must be another group of
              traders consistently losing money. Usually, this group making
              money consistently is small instead of the group of traders who
              consistently lose money. The difference between these two groups
              is their understanding of Risk and their techniques of money
              management. In his book ‘The Disciplined Trader’, Mark Douglas
              says successful trading is 80% money management and 20% strategy.
              I could not agree more. Money management and associated topics
              largely involve the assessment of risk. So in this sense,
              understanding risk and its many forms become essential at this
              point. For this reason, let us break down the risk to its
              elementary form to get a better understanding of risk. The usual
              layman definition of risk in the stock market context is the
              ‘probability of losing money. When you transact in the markets,
              you are exposed to risk, which means you can (possibly) lose
              money. For example, when you buy a company’s stock, whether you
              like it or not, you are exposed to risk. Further, at a very high
              level, risk can be broken down into two types – Systemic Risk and
              Unsystemic Risk. You are automatically exposed to both these
              categories of risks when you own a stock.

            <p>
              <b>Market risk</b>
              <br />
              Whenever you buy or sell a stock, what determines the profit or
              loss? Quite naturally, it's the stock’s price, isn't it? The price
              at which you buy the stock and the price at which you sell it,
              determine the investor’s profit and loss from that investment. And
              given that stock prices keep fluctuating every day and within the
              day too, it's this market risk that every stock market investor
              should be aware of.These ups and downs in stock price are driven
              by not one but multiple factors, but ultimately due to the supply
              and demand at that point of time in the market. Other factors that
              impact the stock price and the demand-supply, include the
              company’s EPS (earning per share), P/E ratio (price-earnings
              ratio), short term trends, liquidity, impact of news, investor
              demographics etc. So, overall, the risk of incurring losses in the
              stock market is what is referred to as market risk. Market risk
              ultimately exists because of the stock price changes/fluctuations.
              <br />
              <b>Interest rate risk</b>
              <br />
              From loans to deposits, changes in interest rates by the
              government are based on the direction in which the economy is
              headed. So, if the interest rates increase, companies get loans at
              higher rates, which can thus cut into their profits and affect
              their stock price.Whereas on the other hand, if interest rates are
              on a downfall, then it can be an indication of a slowdown in the
              economy, which can lower the demand in the market and economy,
              hence leading to businesses suffering losses too, which can not
              only impact their dividend declaration but even impact their stock
              price adversely. That’s why having a balanced interest rate regime
              is often deemed healthy for the stock market as well as the
              economy. A drastic shift towards high or low interest rates can
              sound an alarm.
              <br />
              <b>Company Risk</b>
              <br />
              We all know that a share is a piece of ownership you get in the
              company, as a stock investor. So, ups and downs in a company’s
              performance affect its stock price too. Simply put, if the company
              is performing well, its stock price can witness a rise. Whereas on
              the other hand, losses or problems in business, or downfall in
              revenue, then the stock price can fall.That is why it's always
              advisable for investors to analyze the financial strength,
              management, etc of the company before investing in a company’s
              stock.
              <br />
              <b>Regulatory risks</b>
              <br />
              There are lots of companies listed on the stock market. And all
              such companies are spread across various sectors, aren't they?
              Some belong to the telecom sector, energy sector, whereas others
              are from the financial services sector, pharma sector, agriculture
              sector etc. And amongst all these, many sectors are governed by
              different regulatory bodies and can also involve the government as
              well. So, any change made by the regulator or announced by the
              government can impact the business of all companies in the
              concerned sectors, which can result in a rise or fall in its stock
              price drop.
              <br />
              <b>Liquidity risk</b>
              <br />
              Besides gaining profits from the sale of stock, dividends are
              another source of income in stocks. It is mostly preferred by
              those preferring regular income from their stock investments. And
              to declare dividends, the solvency or liquidity of the company is
              crucial. A company with liquidity problems can cut back on
              dividends or at worse, find it difficult to even clear its bills
              or repay its debts. All this can have an adverse effect on the
              stock price of the company.
              <br />
              <b>Taxability risk</b>
              <br />
              Just like regulations surrounding companies, there are taxability
              rules as well that govern the company whose stock you have
              purchased. And given that the government tends to keep changing
              tax rules based on the needs of the economy, the stock price of
              the company whose sector’s tax laws get tweaked can get affected.
              So, for instance, if the sector in which you purchased stock, gets
              new tax levied or existent tax gets increased, the stock price may
              fall, and vice versa.
              <br />
              <b>Inflation risk</b>
              <br />
              Last but not the least, is the inflation risk. Simply put,
              inflation is an overall increase in the price of commodities and
              products in an economy. When the inflation rate rises, companies
              have to spend more to procure the same amount of raw material. And
              such a rise in inflation reduces the purchasing power of the
              company, which can impact the profitability of the company and
              cause a drop in share prices as well. While these are amongst the
              primary risks impacting the stock market investor and the stock
              prices, there are various other risks as well, like political
              risk, social risk, currency risk, etc. So, it's clear that there
              is a wide array of risks involved in the stock market which an
              investor should be aware of, as all this would impact the
              investment returns as well because of the impact on the stock
              price
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-item-3">Risk to Reward ratio</h4>
            <p>
              The risk to reward ratio is a way for traders to manage short-term
              trading risk. It’s important for a trader to set a limit to how
              much money they may lose per trade, and how much money they may
              lose during a trading period. A trader can limit their per trade
              loss by setting a stop-loss. What’s a stop-loss? It’s a limit to a
              stock price. If a stock loses a specific amount from your purchase
              price, it will automatically be sold at a predetermined price. For
              example, if you buy shares of JJJ Corp. at PHP 2,000 through BDO
              Securities, you may set your stop-loss at PHP 1,950 (2.5% loss).
              If JJJ Corp. reaches PHP 1,950 or below you should sell the stock.
              In order to make a trade with a high risk to reward ratio, you
              will want a stock with a much higher profit potential than loss
              potential. If JJJ Corp.’s price target is PHP 2,150 there is a
              potential gain of 7.5% and a potential loss of 2.5% (stop-loss).
              The gain potential is three times the loss potential (2.5% loss
              potential vs. 7.5% gain potential) It’s important to have a higher
              profit potential than loss potential on a trade.
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-item-4">Understanding stock market risk </h4>
            <p>
              All stock investments carry risk, and risk is the potential to
              lose the money you invest. A risky investment should come with
              higher potential profit but also a higher potential loss.
              Volatility is another form of risk. The more a stock price
              fluctuates, the more volatility the stock has. When it comes to
              short-term trading, having a high winning average and a healthy
              win to loss ratio can help a trader manage downside risk. One way
              traders can muffle losses is by using a stop-loss. A stop-loss can
              help reduce risk and increase both the winning average and risk to
              reward ratio. Diversifying short-term trading with long-term
              investing can also help spread risk. For long-term investing, you
              should diversify your portfolio, which can help reduce volatility.
              You should also hold onto stocks during highly volatile times
              because long-term investing involves holding stocks for
              potentially years. Stock market investing can be a highly
              profitable endeavor - if you understand how to manage risk, you’ll
              be on your way to reach long-term investment success.
