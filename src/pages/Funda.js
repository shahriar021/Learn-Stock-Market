              Introduction to Fundamental Analysis
            </h4>
            <p>
              Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a holistic approach to study a
              business. When an investor wishes to invest in a business for the
              long term (say 3 – 5 years), it becomes essential to understand
              the business from various perspectives. It is critical for an
              investor to separate the daily short term noise in the stock
              prices and concentrate on the underlying business performance.
              Over the long term, a fundamentally strong company’s stock prices
              tend to appreciate, thereby creating wealth for its investors. We
              have many such examples in the Indian market. To name a few, one
              can think of companies such as Infosys Limited, TCS Limited, Page
              Industries, Eicher Motors, Bosch India, Nestle India, TTK Prestige
              etc. Each of these companies has delivered an average over 20%
              compounded annual growth return (CAGR) year on year for over 10
              years. At a 20% CAGR, the investor would double his money in
              roughly about 3.5 years to give you a perspective. Higher the CAGR
              faster is the wealth creation process. Some companies such as
              Bosch India Limited have delivered close to 30% CAGR. Therefore,
              you can imagine the magnitude and the speed at which wealth is
              created if one would invest in fundamentally strong companies.

              Fundamental analysis is usually done from a macro to micro
              perspective to identify securities that are not correctly priced
              by the market. Analysts typically study, in order: The overall
              state of the economy The strength of the specific industry The
              financial performance of the company issuing the stock This
              ensures they arrive at a fair market value for the stock.Sources
              for Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis uses publicly
              available financial data to evaluate the value of an investment.
              The data is recorded on financial statements such as quarterly and
              annual reports and filings like the 10-Q (quarterly) or 10-K
              (annual). The 8-K is also informative because public companies
              must file it any time a reportable event occurs, like an
              acquisition or upper-level management change.For example, you
              might perform a fundamental analysis of a bond's value by looking
              at economic factors such as interest rates and the overall state
              of the economy. Then, you'd evaluate the bond market and use
              financial data from similar bond issuers. Finally, you'd analyze
              the financial data from the issuing company, including external
              factors such as potential changes in its credit rating. You could
              also read through the 8-K, 10-Q, 10-K, and the issuer's annual
              reports to find out what they are doing, their goals, or other
              issues. Fundamental analysis uses a company's revenues, earnings,
              future growth, return on equity, profit margins, and other data to
              determine a company's underlying value and potential for future
              growth.

              The tools required for fundamental analysis are extremely basic,
              most of which are available for free. Specifically you would need
              the following:
              <br />
              1. Annual report of the company – All the information that you
              need for FA is available in the annual report. You can download
              the annual report from the company’s website for free 5
              <br /> 2. Industry related data – You will need industry data to
              see how the company under consideration is performing with respect
              to the industry. Basic data is available for free, and is usually
              published in the industry’s association website
              <br /> 3. Access to news – Daily News helps you stay updated on
              latest developments happening both in the industry and the company
              you are interested in. A good business news paper or services such
              as Google Alert can help you stay abreast of the latest news
              <br /> 4. MS Excel – Although not free, MS Excel can be extremely
              helpful in fundamental calculations With just these four tools,
              one can develop fundamental analysis that can rival institutional
              research. You can believe me when I say that you don’t need any
              other tool to do good fundamental research. In fact even at the
              institutional level the objective is to keep the research simple
              and logical.

              Why Is Fundamental Analysis Important?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Fundamental analysis allows you to see what the market value for a
              company should be. Many investors only look at the price a stock
              is currently trading at and what it has traded at instead of
              analyzing what lies behind the stock. A stock is issued by a
              company, so its overall performance is related to the financial
              performance of the company.

              Why complete a fundamental analysis?
            </h4>
            <p>
              There are many reasons to conduct a fundamental analysis of an
              investment, including: To measure the intrinsic value of the
              investment: The primary purpose of conducting a fundamental
              analysis is to measure the intrinsic value, or fair market value,
              of an investment. The intrinsic value refers to the objective, or
              perceived, value of a specific trade. To make trading decisions:
              The information that comes from a fundamental analysis can help
              investors decide whether a stock is under or overvalued. This can
              help investors make informed decisions on whether to hold or trade
              a stock. To make trade recommendations: Financial advisers and
              analysts may also use fundamental analyses to make trade
              recommendations to their clients. If an investor calculates an
              intrinsic value much higher than the stock's current price, they
              may advise their client to buy, and if the value is lower than the
              price, they may recommend that they sell. To project future
              performance: Calculating the intrinsic value of an investment can
              also help an investor predict future performance. The investor can
              make informed estimates at how much they can expect to return with
              each investment. To measure management's efficiency: Because
              completing a fundamental analysis includes evaluating revenue and
              payouts, it can also help measure management's performance. This
              can help businesses identify any additional management needs.
