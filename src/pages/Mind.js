              You should be relentless in developing skills in how to master
              yourself and your risk tolerance. Some traders love the action,
              others dream of easy money, but the really good traders think
              about how to develop trading strategies. The work should be your
              goal. Money and action are just a byproduct for keeping score on
              your performance. The trading mindset should be about how to
              perform the best. Trading decisions are all about being truthful
              to yourself. The success rate is in direct proportion to your
              talent, skills, work ethics, and truthfulness. Not everyone can
              become a trader. Mark Minervi was interviewed in Jack Schwager‘s
              Stock Market Wizards. Here is a quote from that interview (page
              176): “The fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the
              honesty and sincerity of your own effort in keeping your own
              records, doing your own thinking, and reaching your own
              conclusions. In other words, take 100 percent responsibility for
              your results.” Dedication to your job is thus paramount.

            <h4 id="simple-list-item-2">A trader must know himself/herself</h4>
            <p>
              This is vital in developing quantified strategies. You have to get
              an understanding of who you are and your personality traits. What
              is the best personality trait for trading? Are you introverted or
              extroverted? Are you disciplined? Are you able to work on your
              own? Are you confident by nature? What is your aim? Why do you
              trade? Trading is solitary, it attracts people that are
              introverted. The ones with intuition backed up by gut feel can get
              some kind of a game going in a few months or a year or two but not
              for the long term, in our opinion. The ones that back up intuition
              with thinking take much longer to get a game plan and they can
              last longer. Emotions can’t be part of any investment strategy.
              Many want to “make a lot of money” when they start trading. They
              want to stay at home and have no commuting. The dream of an easy
              life seems so appealing. Occasionally go to the cafe and trade
              from there. They are about to get a nasty surprise when they
              understand the trading psychology is not as easy as it seemed.
              Trading is an intellectual endeavor where most investors fail to
              make any money. Not only is it difficult to find trading edges and
              strategies, but you need to execute the strategies. The biggest
              obstacle is implementing your plans. You have to master yourself
              and undergo personality change in order to get your trading
              implemented properly.

            <h4 id="simple-list-item-3">A trader stays focused all the time</h4>
            <p>
              If you decide to open a pizza shop, most likely you’ll set up some
              plans for how to proceed. Perhaps making budgets and even some
              marketing research to check the viability of the plan. Do you
              think a potential trader does all this? Probably not. But you need
              to have a business plan and develop some kind of methodology if
              you want a trading career. The methodology and techniques have to
              be linked to your dominant personality trait. It’s better to have
              a bad methodology than no methodology at all. This takes time, a
              lot of time. You first need an idea, some kind of hypothesis, and
              then you need to backtest the idea to check if it has any
              statistical edge. For some, this is the easy part. The tricky part
              is to execute the trading plan. It all looks so easy when you have
              the answer in front of you in a backtest. The problem arises when
              you are about to pull the trigger. The future result is uncertain.
              All you know is the past. Self-doubt kicks in. After a drawdown,
              you might lose faith in the system and stop trading, perhaps
              exactly at the wrong time. Therefore, you need to practice and
              stay focused on what you should do. Try to avoid thinking in terms
              of money. The focus should be on execution. We recommend you
              automate most of your trading.
            </p>
            <h4 id="simple-list-item-4">Trading Discipline</h4>
            <p>
              Discipline is for many a negative word. We quote from Wikipedia:
              Self-discipline can be defined as the ability to motivate oneself
              in spite of a negative emotional state. Qualities associated with
              self-discipline include willpower, hard work, and persistence.
              Self-discipline is the product of persistent willpower. Whereas
              willpower is the strength and ability to carry out a certain task,
              self-discipline is the ability to use it routinely and even
              automatically. We can say willpower is like a muscle, where
              self-discipline is the thoughts that control the muscle. Again,
              Mark Minervi gives a very good analogy: “The first time I
              seriously watched a poker game in a casino I noticed that the
              average winning hand was over 50 USD, but that it only cost you 50
              cents to see the first three cards. I couldn’t believe that for
              half a dollar I could get a pretty good idea of my chances of
              winning a hundred times that amount. If I folded fifty times and
              won only once, I would still win twice as much as I lost. Those
              seemed like terrific odds to me. That’s how I got started playing
              poker. My strategy was to only play super-high-probability hands.
              Schwager: Didn’t everyone just fold once you played a hand? No,
              and you know why? Because they were not disciplined, and they
              wanted to play. The key is to know when to do nothing. Most
              people, even if they have a winning strategy, will not follow it
              because they lack discipline.” Willpower, willingness to work
              hard, and persistence are not traits that many people have. No
              wonder this brings negative thoughts to many. However, trading is
              not a military boot camp, but be honest with yourself to check if
              you have any of these three traits. If not, trading can be quite
              hard. A certain amount of rules are needed to trade well. Even the
              legendary trader Jesse Livermore used rules to limit himself from
              doing foolish trades. We advocate systematic trading based on
              quantified analysis, and this is of course rule-based. The tricky
              part is to execute the system because you need confidence:

              A good trader separates confidence and overconfidence
            </h4>
            <p>
              rading is not different from any other demanding undertaking: It
              requires mastering the different stages of the learning curve and
              the quality of this learning process depends on how focused and
              disciplined the trader is in honoring his acquired skills. If
              you’re confident, it’s a lot easier to execute your methodology.
              To become confident you have to acquire the mentality mentioned
              above. Admit when you are wrong and realize that being wrong is
              the cost of doing business. However, there is a thin line between
              confidence and overconfidence in trading. Brett Steenbarger has
              written an interesting book about trading psychology, has a blog,
              and has developed personality tests for traders. According to him,
              overconfidence is the worst trait a trader can have. Here is an
              excerpt from his blog: Studies in behavioral finance find that
              about 3/4 of all traders rate their prowess as “above average”,
              despite the obvious reality that only half of us are better than
              the other half. This overconfidence, moreover, affects actual
              trading performance. Research by Terence Odean and colleagues
              finds that overconfidence affects frequency of trading, which in
              turn contributes to poor trading results. In one study of online
              traders, the group of traders favored high beta (volatile) small
              cap companies and tended to not diversify their portfolios. Their
              actual trading results slightly beat the small cap index, but
              after trading costs were factored in, they significantly
              underperformed the index. The most frequent traders were the ones
              who underperformed the index by the greatest margin…….One of my
              favorite studies of overconfidence came from the London Business
              School. Traders were shown price patterns and asked to figure out
              the market’s next direction and indicate their confidence in their
              prediction. The price patterns were generated entirely randomly.
              The traders with the highest confidence in their predictions
              traded the most frequently and incurred the greatest losses.
              Steenbarger’s argument is a strong case for having a mechanical
              trading system. Certainly, this applies to those who tend to be
              extroverts and/or impulsive. Don’t be a hero. Don’t have an ego.
              Always question yourself and your ability. Don’t ever feel that
              you are very good. The second you do, you are dead… my guiding
              philosophy is playing great defense. If you make a good trade,
              don’t think it is because you have some uncanny foresight. Always
              maintain your sense of confidence, but keep it in check. – Paul
              Tudor Jones II

            <p>
              Trading is a probability game. Find a profitable methodology by
              testing and implement it. Diversify to several strategies (with
              the lowest correlation possible). Try to make trading as easy and
              smooth as possible. Ignore money. Feel detachment to money. Focus
              on what you should do. Keep it simple! Trading is really simple,
              but still, most of us make it really complicated. The correct
              mindset in trading takes years of trial and error til develop.
